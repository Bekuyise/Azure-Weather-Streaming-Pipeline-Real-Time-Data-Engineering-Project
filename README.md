# 🌦️ Azure Weather Streaming Pipeline – Real-Time Data Engineering Project

# 🚀 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world scenario where weather and air quality data is ingested, processed, and visualized in real time using Microsoft Azure. Built as an end-to-end cloud-native data engineering pipeline, the solution leverages multiple Azure services for ingestion, streaming, transformation, alerting, and visualization.

The goal is to provide accurate, up-to-the-minute environmental insights that can be used for public safety, environmental monitoring, or operational decision-making.


# 🎯 Business Problem

### A smart city organization wants to monitor live weather and pollution conditions to:

🚨 Detect and act on hazardous air quality in real time

🌐 Centralize data from  Chennai geographic location

📊 Deliver live dashboards and alerts for public and internal stakeholders
